3D endless world rendering in Java using LWJGL3

This project was made because i had nothing better to do during summer holidays :).
It renders endlessly generated world. World is generated using Simplex Noise from bukkit.
Rendering is done by using OpenGL in lwjgl3. I tried to use newest OpenGL. Also shaders are used.
